     <h3>And as the episode's continue there come's season 2 where there are 2 main character that is
      Suguru Geto, and Satoru Gojo well mostly Gojo is the main, then the villain there was

     <h3>But every anime has a movie of it jjk has it too its called "Jujutsu Kaisen Movie 0" where the main character
      is Yuta Nakamoto and the main Villain is Suguru Geto, yes i know, how did Geto ended up to be the Villain in there
      well it was at the jjk season 2 episode 3 you'll understand it soon,NOW back to the main when Yuta was little he liked a girl named Rika,
      they made a promise ring that they'll get married when they're older but she ended up dead cause by hitting a car
      but Yuta cant accept the fact she's dead (i dont know how to explain the part so ima skip) then skip to
      when Yuta got into the Jujutsu highschool then SKIP TO THE EMOTIONAL BATTLE where yuta fight's against Geto then yuta won
      Geto was defeated and gone to hide himself cause he was badly injured but Gojo found him in the end they talk a while
      in the end Geto told Gojo to just end his life and so Gojo did and i dont know the rest
